Here is the comprehensive plan for evaluating the necessity of Tiny Slider and making any necessary adjustments:

**Plan:**
1. **Evaluate Tiny Slider Usage**:
   - Check if there are any references to Tiny Slider in the project files, particularly in JavaScript files or other HTML files.
   - If Tiny Slider is not being used, it can be safely removed from the project.

2. **Remove Unused Files**:
   - If Tiny Slider is confirmed to be unused, remove the associated JavaScript file (`js/tiny-slider.js`) and any related CSS files (if applicable).

3. **Test the Site**:
   - After removing Tiny Slider, test the website to ensure that all functionalities remain intact and that the layout is not affected.

4. **Document Changes**:
   - Keep a record of the changes made and the reasons for removing Tiny Slider, in case it needs to be referenced in the future.

Please confirm if I can proceed with this plan or if you have any feedback or changes to suggest.
