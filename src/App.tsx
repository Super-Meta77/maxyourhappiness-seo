                I'd been dating this guy who was not a great guy, and I'd been
                with him for about five years and I could not let go of him. I
                couldn't. I knew he was wrong for me. I knew I didn't actually
                want to be with him, but I couldn't not be with him. It was like
                out of my control.

                <strong>AFTER</strong><br />
                So I was actually able to realize, No, I don't want to be with
                this guy and I can stop being with him. And I was able to put an
                end to that and move on with my life and opened the door to
                actually having a great relationship with my husband. It was a big
                part of me having three wonderful births. My kids are amazing. Of
                course, every mom says that, but they really, truly are. And
                everything I read in that book is part of what I do.

                There was an injury, you know, when I was a kid, cut my knee open.
                It wasn't the knee that was painful. The painful part was the
                embarrassment, because the girl that I had a crush on was there
                and saw me being tended to. It was that feeling of helpless. That
                actually is what stuck with me. The reactive mind was just
                connecting it. Here's a girl. Here's a moment of you being weak.
                You have to be stronger. You have to do this. You have to build
                walls. You have to be a man. You have to be. So, we get to the
                root of it.

                me.

                and depression. And you just never knew when, like the anxiety was
                going to turn on and you were going to be have your car pulled
                over having a panic attack.

                had had before in terms of my ability to communicate more freely.
                And I had lost that. And it was this thing that I carried with me

                my negative emotions, had been trapped.

                This explained so much to me about why people behave as they do. It allows me to understand people and to
                know that when someone is being irrational that it's not really them but their reactive mind. This helps
                me in dealing with situations in my life.

                Absolutely life changing! <br />
                My personal problem was that I had trouble speaking to people. I was afraid. There was no reason for it,
                it was completely irrational. But it was a huge problem for me in business deals, speaking with
                professors, giving presentations, and just generally being social. This not only was able to tell me why I
                had this problem and where it came from, but also HOW TO FIX IT. That's what really impressed me the most
                - it actually will fix the things that give you trouble in life, not just talk about them or give you some
                vague idea of what needs to be done.

                WOW! I have tried to actually use so many different philosophies and practices in my life to make things
                better. Some helped a little, some helped more. But, this has the information about why individuals,
                systems, civilizations, marriages, religions and groups don't make it, long term. This is astonishing.

                Can make decisions easily now <br />
                Before reading this, I had a lot of trouble making decisions. I would think about things and ponder them
                and often would end up getting nothing done or putting life choices off over and over again. It explained
                to me why it was that I took so long to make decisions and why sometimes I made the wrong ones. This has
                helped me so much in getting things done to lead a generally happier life. Thank you!

                There are few that can take one on a journey like this one! The freedom that I have experienced in my life
                and the return of memory that this has handed me is impossible to describe. That said, this isn't about me
                it's about you and helping you get rid of influences that make life less fun. This has helped me in life,
                marriage, work, raising kids, and with family. I recommend it highly to anyone that wants to truly
                understand their mind and how it really works.

                ...actually handled my depression <br />
                I had severe depression after having my baby. Nothing seemed to help and I didn't want to be on pills for
                the rest of my life. Then I found this that's based on modern science. It made so much sense, and finally
                I felt like my questions were answered and I knew how and why I was feeling that way. I followed the
                instructions and I started getting better right away. I highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't want
                to take pills to handle their depression.

                A fascinating, about the mind (and much more) <br />
                This is built around the idea that something positive can be done to not only address things I didn't
                understand or like about myself but also how to move forward no matter how crazy things get out there. I
                also really appreciated the understanding it gave me about other people. One thing I learned over the last
                few years is how important it is to take charge of my own life and my own health, physical and mental.
                This gave me a deep understanding and tools I can use pretty much every day.

                  It just makes sense <br />
                  This was different. It just totally makes sense. It's very simple and I like that the science involved is
                  100% invariable to every person..
